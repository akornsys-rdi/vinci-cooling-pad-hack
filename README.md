_Vincihackens_ is a hack of the cooling pad for laptop Vinci Tacens. While it's 
focused on this particular model, you can theoretically made at any cooling 
pad. The purpose of this hack is to improve efficiency of the pad, while 
responsive to the environment.

Vincihackens is free software/hardware. See License Information below.

## Installation and use ##

_Vincihackens_ is intended to be a short project, which uses basic components 
of an electronic laboratory or hackspace. It's made of two prototyping boards 
and requires few changes from the original installation.  
It''s necessary to modify the original PCB, to access the potentiometer and
isolate USB of the new assembly. Also, a hole for mounting the power connector
barrel-type is machined. The original white LED is replaced by one RGB, and the
lateral switch is replaced to a pushbutton of the same type. Cable management is
done in empty spaces. The temperature sensor is mounted in the grill, and
additionally the brand plate is changed to a customized one.
